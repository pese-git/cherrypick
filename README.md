# CherryPick Workspace

CherryPick Workspace is a modular, open-source dependency injection ecosystem for Dart and Flutter, designed to offer lightweight, flexible, and scalable DI suitable for both backend and frontend (Flutter) development. This monorepo contains the main DI runtime library, annotation helpers, code generation for modular bindings, and seamless Flutter integration.

---

## Packages Overview

- **[`cherrypick`](./cherrypick)**  
  The core dependency injection library. Supports modular bindings, hierarchical scopes, named and singleton bindings, provider functions (sync/async), runtime parameters, and test-friendly composition.  
  _Intended for use in pure Dart and Flutter projects._

- **[`cherrypick_annotations`](./cherrypick_annotations)**  
  A set of Dart annotations (`@module`, `@singleton`, `@instance`, `@provide`, `@named`, `@params`) enabling concise, declarative DI modules and providers, primarily for use with code generation tools.

- **[`cherrypick_generator`](./cherrypick_generator)**  
  A [source_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/source_gen)-based code generator that automatically converts your annotated modules and providers into ready-to-use boilerplate for registration and resolution within your app.  
  _Reduces manual wiring and errors; compatible with build_runner._

- **[`cherrypick_flutter`](./cherrypick_flutter)**  
  Adds Flutter-native integration, exposing DI scopes and modules to the widget tree through `CherryPickProvider` and enabling dependency management throughout your Flutter app.

## Why CherryPick?

- **Zero-overhead and intuitive API:**  
  Clean, minimal syntax, strong typing, powerful binding lifecycle control.
- **High testability:**  
  Supports overriding and hierarchical scope trees.
- **Both Sync & Async support:**  
  Register and resolve async providers, factories, and dependencies.
- **Seamless code generation:**  
  Effortless setup with annotations + generator‚Äîskip boilerplate!
- **Works with or without Flutter.**
- **Production ready:**  
  Robust enough for apps, packages, and server-side Dart.
- **Extensible & Modular:**  
  Add bindings at runtime, use sub-modules, or integrate via codegen.

## Get Started

### 1. Add dependencies

In your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cherrypick: ^<latest-version>
  cherrypick_annotations: ^<latest-version>

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^<latest>
  cherrypick_generator: ^<latest-version>
```

For Flutter projects, add:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cherrypick_flutter: ^<latest-version>
```

### 2. Write a DI Module (with annotations)

```dart
import 'package:cherrypick_annotations/cherrypick_annotations.dart';
import 'package:cherrypick/cherrypick.dart';

@module()
abstract class MyModule extends Module {
  @singleton()
  ApiClient apiClient() => ApiClient();

  @provide()
  DataRepository dataRepo(ApiClient client) => DataRepository(client);

  @provide()
  String greeting(@params() String name) => 'Hello, $name!';
}
```

### 3. Generate the bindings

```sh
dart run build_runner build
# or for Flutter:
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

The generator will create a `$MyModule` class with binding code.

### 4. Install and Resolve

```dart
final scope = CherryPick.openRootScope()
  ..installModules([$MyModule()]);

final repo = scope.resolve<DataRepository>();
final greeting = scope.resolveWithParams<String>('John'); // 'Hello, John!'
```

_For Flutter, wrap your app with `CherryPickProvider` for DI scopes in the widget tree:_

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    CherryPickProvider(child: MyApp()),
  );
}
```
